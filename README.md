> Sample Project for JWT authentication in a Single Page App

This project was inspired by [known issues for storing JWT tokens in an SPA](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44209185/8210954), and serves as an attempt at a MEVN stack implementation of a [two-cookie SPA authentication method](https://medium.com/lightrail/getting-token-authentication-right-in-a-stateless-single-page-application-57d0c6474e3).

## Goals

- Reduce the surface area of attack for user authentication
- Compatibility with OAuth 2.0 and good ol' username + password
- Username and password can be supplemented with optional 2FA
- Users can get a different post-login user experience depending on their account type and user permissions
- Sessions can be terminated in client or server
- Sessions can be expired after a given amount of time

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

To start the dev client and server, run:

```sh
yarn start
```

Then navigate to localhost:8080.

## Notes

- By signing JWT tokens with a uuid-generated string generated for each user, this method remains stateful to avoid user forging.
